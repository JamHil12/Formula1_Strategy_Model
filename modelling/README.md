It is recommended to familiarise yourself with the Jupyter notebooks first, as these help to visually show what each function defined in the Python files does.

| File Name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Modelling_Utilities.py | Contains the raw definitions of the core functions used for modelling in the other files |
| Modelling_SingleCar.ipynb | Jupyter notebook showcasing how the functions from *Modelling_Utilities.py* can be used |
| Modelling_TyreDegCurveFit_XXX.ipynb | Jupyter notebook showcasing how to fit a tyre deg and fuel effect linear regression model, on the data from a particular Grand Prix |
| Modelling__Master.py | Python-only version of the notebook *Modelling_SingleCar.ipynb* |
