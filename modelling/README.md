It is recommended to familiarise yourself with the Jupyter notebooks first, as these help to visually show what each function does.

| File Name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |

| Modelling_SingleCar.ipynb | Jupyter notebook showcasing how the functions from *Modelling_Utilities.py* can be used |
