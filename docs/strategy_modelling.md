It is recommended to familiarise yourself with the Jupyter notebooks in the [build](https://github.com/JamHil12/Formula1_Strategy_Model/tree/master/build) folder first.
Those notebooks visually demonstrate what each function defined in the Python files does.

| Folder | File Name | Description |
| ------------ | ------------ | ----------- |
| src | modelling_utilities.py | Defines the core functions used for strategy modelling and optimisation |
| src | modelling__master.py | Implements the functions from modelling_utilities.py, including parameter sweep visualisation |
| build | parameter_sweep_optimisation.ipynb | Jupyter notebook showcasing how the functions from Modelling_Utilities.py can visualise optimal race strategy choices |
| build | curve_fitting_lap_time_deg.ipynb | Jupyter notebook showcasing how to fit a tyre deg and fuel effect  regression model on historical F1 race data |
